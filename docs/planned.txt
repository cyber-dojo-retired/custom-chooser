/group_choose
------------
Currently, this only allows a single display-name to be selected.
I plan to allow multiple (max 3?) display-names to be selected,
and for the selected manifests to be associated with a group-session.
To join such a group, an individual display-name will need to be selected.

Further on still, the dashboard for such a group could have one tab for all
participants, and a further tab for each display-name.
