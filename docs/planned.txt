/index_group
------------
Currently, this only allows a single display-name can be selected
when creating a custom-group session.
At some point I plan to allow multiple display-names to be selected,
and for multiple manifests to be associated with a group-session.
When joining such a group, a display-name will need to be selected.
Moreover, the dashboard for such a group will have one tab for all
participants, and a further tab for each display-name.
