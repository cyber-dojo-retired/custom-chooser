/group_choose
------------
Currently, this only allows a single display-name can be selected.
At some point I plan to allow multiple (max 3?) display-names to be selected,
and for multiple manifests to be associated with a group-session.
When joining such a group, an individual display-name will need to be selected.
Moreover, the dashboard for such a group will have one tab for all
participants, and a further tab for each display-name.
