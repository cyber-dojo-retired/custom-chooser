# 1 create separate App class and super-thin Creator class (see creator)
# 2 add error handler (see creator)
# 3 ensure Custom.new object is created for each incoming request
#   but as @custom in tests so externals can be stubbed
# 4 add **splat handling
# 5 add button disable/enable wrapping around ajax call
# 6 check error handling in JS when creator fails
# 7 check error handling in JS when saver fails. creator needs to pass saver error 'through'
